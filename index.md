üëã My name is Stefanos Laskaridis and I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist specializing in Machine Learning (ML), Distributed & Mobile Systems, and Efficient ML algorithms.
My research interest revolve around the areas of dynamic network architectures, federated/collaborative learning, on-device AI as well resource and energy-efficient deep learning.

Currently, I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/), where I focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alexa+, particularly in the areas of self-learning and speculative decoding for efficient inference.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at [Brave Software](https://brave.com/research/) and as a Visiting Researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/sl829), where I focused on on-device GenAI, privacy-preserving machine learning as well as modular LLM architectures.

Before that, I spent 4.5 years as a research scientist at [Samsung AI Center](https://research.samsung.com/aicentre_cambridge) in Cambridge, UK, working in the areas of **distributed**, **collaborative** and **efficient edge AI**.
I graduated from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) and, prior to that, I worked at [CERN](https://cern.ch), in Geneva, contributing to large-scale distributed storage systems.

In my free time, I love _travelling_, _motorsport_ and _photography_. I am also passionate about the topics of _open-source_, _AGI_ and _privacy_ and like partaking in _hackathons_ from time to time. Oh, I also like coffee ‚òïÔ∏è ...
