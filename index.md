---

My name is Stefanos Laskaridis, I am from Greece and I am into Machine Learning and Distributed Systems.
Currently, I am researcher at [Samsung AI Center](https://research.samsung.com/aicentre_cambridge) in Cambridge, UK,
focusing on the area of **Federated Learning** and **efficient on-device** or **collaborative ML**.
Previously, I did my MPhil in the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) and prior to that I was a
Software Engineer at [CERN](https://cern.ch), in Geneva, Switzerland.

In my free time, I love travelling, motorsports and photography.
